# Installs directly on your Chrome browser

Swagger.ed ships with a pre-built Chrome extension add-on that installs directly on your browser by dragging-n-dropping it onto the extensions page. 

# Download the add-on

Click on the button to download the **swagger.ed** add-on.   


<div markdown="0" class="text-center" style='margin-top: 40px;'><a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/swagger.ed/raw/master/chrome-ext/dist/swagger.ed.crx" class="btn" style='font-size: 28px; background-color: #f1c40f;'>Download the Chrome extension</a></div>

Now, click on the Chrome menu (upper right side of the browser window) and go to **More Tools-> Extensions**.  The extensions page will open - drag-n-drop the **.crx** file anywhere onto the page.

After dropping the **add-on** file (*.crx), Chrome will ask you to confirm installation.

As soon as you press the 'Add' button, a small icon will show appear on the right corner of the address bar - this is called a **page action**.  Now, every time you visit a URL that contains content 'recognized' by the **swagger.ed** add-on, the little icon will appear prompting you to click on it.

And that's pretty much it!

### Time for the cool stuff

If you've reached this point and everything went down smoothly with the installation, now it's time to start seeing things in action.
